## 🛠️ سكريبت تصنيف الملفات تلقائياً

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
import os, re, shutil
from pathlib import Path

CATEGORIES = {
    'medical': [r'عظم', r'جراحة', r'أشعة', r'dicom', r'orthopedic',

    text_lower = text.lower()
    for cat, keywords in CATEGORIES.items():
        if any(re.search(kw, text_lower, re.IGNORECASE) for kw in keywords):
            return cat
    return 'uncategorized'

def organize_files(source_dir, output_dir):
    Path(output_dir).mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)
    
    for root, _, files in os.walk(source_dir):
        for fname in files:
            if fname.lower().endswith(('.txt', '.md')):
                fpath = Path(root) / fname
                try:
                    content = fpath.read_text(encoding='utf-8', errors='ignore')

                    dest_dir.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)
                    shutil.copy2(fpath, dest_dir / fname)
                    print(f"✓ {fname} → {category}")
                except Exception as e:
                    print(f"✗ خطأ في {fname}: {e}")
```

## 🔄 سكريبت توحيد التنسيق ثنائي اللغة

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
import re
from pathlib import Path

def is_arabic(text):
    return bool(re.search(r'[\u0600-\u06FF]', text))

def standardize_pair(eng, ara):
    """توحيد الجملة الإنجليزية ← العربية بتنسيق TSV"""
    eng = re.sub(r'\s+', ' ', eng.strip())
    ara = re.sub(r'\s+', ' ', ara.strip())
    return f"{eng}\t{ara}"

def process_file(fpath, output_dir):
    content = fpath.read_text(encoding='utf-8', errors='ignore')
    lines = [l.strip() for l in content.splitlines() if l.strip()]
    
    pairs = []
    i = 0
    while i < len(lines) - 1:
        if is_arabic(lines[i]) != is_arabic(lines[i+1]):
            eng = lines[i] if not is_arabic(lines[i]) else lines[i+1]
            ara = lines[i+1] if is_arabic(lines[i+1]) else lines[i]
            pairs.append(standardize_pair(eng, ara))
            i += 2
        else:
            i += 1
    
    if pairs:
        out_path = Path(output_dir) / f"{fpath.stem}.tsv"
        out_path.write_text('\n'.join(pairs), encoding='utf-8')
        print(f"✓ حول {fpath.name} → {len(pairs)} زوج لغوي")
```

---

## 🧹 سكريبت إزالة التكرارات

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
import hashlib

def hash_pair(pair):
    return hashlib.md5(pair.lower().encode('utf-8')).hexdigest()

def deduplicate_tsv(input_path, output_path):
    seen = set()
    unique = []
    
    with open(input_path, 'r', encoding='utf-8') as f:
        for line in f:
            h = hash_pair(line)
            if h not in seen:
                seen.add(h)
                unique.append(line)
    
    with open(output_path, 'w', encoding='utf-8') as f:
        f.writelines(unique)
    
    print(f"✓ {input_path}: {len(unique)} فريد من أصل {len(seen)}")
```

## 💡 نصائح لتدريب النماذج

### لـ Hugging Face
حول الملفات إلى تنسيق JSONL:
```json
{"translation": {"en": "Fracture of femur", "ar": "كسر في عظمة الفخذ"}}
```

### لتحسين الجودة
أضف عمود "ثقة" (confidence) بعد معالجة النصوص بـ OCR

### للمشاريع الطبية
ركز على `data/medical/` - هذه الأكثر قيمة للتدريب المتخصص

---

## 📤 تحويل لتنسيقات التدريب

### JSONL لـ Hugging Face

```python
import json

def tsv_to_jsonl(tsv_path, jsonl_path):
    with open(tsv_path, 'r', encoding='utf-8') as f:
        lines = f.readlines()
    
    with open(jsonl_path, 'w', encoding='utf-8') as f:
        for line in lines:
            parts = line.strip().split('\t')
            if len(parts) >= 2:
                obj = {"translation": {"en": parts[0], "ar": parts[1]}}
                f.write(json.dumps(obj, ensure_ascii=False) + '\n')
```

### 1. بدون ذكاء اصطناعي (فقط إزالة التكرارات)

```bash
python corpus_dedup_ai.py -i ./files -o ./processed --no-ai
```

### 2. استخدام Ollama (مجاني محلياً)

```bash
# تشغيل Ollama أولاً
ollama serve

# في نافذة أخرى
python corpus_dedup_ai.py -i ./files -o ./processed --api ollama
```

### 3. استخدام OpenRouter (نماذج مجانية)

```bash
# الحصول على API key مجاني من openrouter.ai
python corpus_dedup_ai.py -i ./files -o ./processed \
    --api openrouter \
    --api-key sk-or-v1-xxxxx
```

```bash
# الحصول على API key من platform.deepseek.com
python corpus_dedup_ai.py -i ./files -o ./processed \
    --api deepseek \
    --api-key sk-xxxxx
```

### 5. تحديد عتبة التشابه

```bash
# عتبة عالية (90%) - يحتفظ بملفات أكثر تشابهاً
python corpus_dedup_ai.py -i ./files -o ./processed --threshold 0.9

# عتبة منخفضة (70%) - يحذف ملفات أقل تشابهاً
python corpus_dedup_ai.py -i ./files -o ./processed --threshold 0.7
```

## خيارات سطر الأوامر

| الخيار | الوصف | الافتراضي |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| `-i, --input` | مسار الملفات | (مطلوب) |
| `-o, --output` | مسار الإخراج | `./dedup_output` |
| `-t, --threshold` | عتبة التشابه (0-1) | 0.85 |
| `--api` | نوع API | None |
| `--api-key` | مفتاح API | None |
| `--model` | اسم النموذج | تلقائي |
| `--no-ai` | تعطيل AI | False |

    "unique_files": 75,
    "duplicates_found": 25,
    "exact_duplicates": 15,
    "near_duplicates": 10
  }
}
```

## تحليل AI (ai_analysis.json)

```json
[
  {
    "file": "medical_report.txt",
    "size": 5432,
    "hash": "abc123...",
    "summary": "تقرير طبي عن حالات العظام...",

      "category": "طبي",
      "topics": ["عظام", "جراحة"],
      "language": "العربية",
      "quality": "عالية"
    },
    "keywords": ["عظام", "جراحة", "علاج", "مريض"]
  }
]
```

## أمثلة عملية

### مثال 1: تنظيف قاعدة معرفة

```bash
# لديك 1000 ملف نصي، بعضها مكرر
python corpus_dedup_ai.py -i ./knowledge_base -o ./clean_base --api ollama

# النتيجة: فقط الملفات الفريدة مع تلخيصات
```

### مثال 2: دمج ملفات من مصادر متعددة

```bash
# دمج ملفات من عدة مجلدات
python corpus_dedup_ai.py -i ./all_sources -o ./merged --no-ai

# ثم تحليل الفريدة
python corpus_dedup_ai.py -i ./merged/unique_files -o ./analyzed --api ollama
```

### مثال 3: معالجة ملفات كبيرة

```bash
# عتبة عالية للملفات الكبيرة
python corpus_dedup_ai.py -i ./large_corpus -o ./processed \
    --threshold 0.95 \
    --api deepseek \
    --api-key YOUR_KEY
```

## نصائح

### لتحسين الأداء

1. **استخدم Ollama محلياً** - أسرع وأمان
2. **قسم الملفات الكبيرة** - معالجة على مراحل
3. **اضبط العتبة** - 0.85 مناسب للنصوص العربية

### للحصول على أفضل النتائج

1. **تأكد من ترميز الملفات** - UTF-8 مفضل
2. **أزل الملفات غير النصية** - قبل المعالجة
3. **راجع التقرير** - تحقق من التكرارات المحذوفة

## استكشاف الأخطاء

### Ollama لا يعمل
```bash
# تحقق من تشغيل الخادم
curl http://localhost:11434/api/tags

# أعد تشغيل
ollama serve
```

### API key غير صالح
```bash
# تأكد من صحة المفتاح
# OpenRouter: https://openrouter.ai/keys
# DeepSeek: https://platform.deepseek.com/api_keys
```

### ملفات غير مقروءة
- تحقق من ترميز الملف
- تأكد من أن الملف نصي
- جرب تحويل الترميز

## مقارنة APIs

| الميزة | Ollama | OpenRouter | DeepSeek |
|--------|--------|------------|----------|
| التكلفة | مجاني | مجاني/مدفوع | رخيص |
| الخصوصية | 100% | على السحابة | على السحابة |
| السرعة | سريع | متوسط | سريع |
| الجودة | جيد | ممتاز | ممتاز |
| التثبيت | مطلوب | بدون تثبيت | بدون تثبيت |

## ⚡ ميزات متقدمة

### 1. إزالة التكرارات الذكية

يستخدم **MinHash LSH** للكشف عن التكرارات المتشابهة (وليس المتطابقة فقط):

```python
# عتبة التشابه (0.85 = 85%)
SIMILARITY_THRESHOLD = 0.85
```

### 2. تصحيح إملائي تلقائي

يكشف ويصحح الأخطاء الشائعة:

```
انشاء → إنشاء
الان → الآن
الى → إلى
ايضاً → أيضاً
ذالك → ذلك
```

### 3. تقييم الجودة

يحسب نقاط جودة لكل مقطع:

- طول النص
- نسبة الرموز غير المفيدة
- وجود garbage characters
- نسبة الكلمات المتكررة

### 4. حفظ التقدم

- حفظ تلقائي كل 100 ملف
- استكمال من حيث توقف
- حماية من فقدان البيانات

---

## 📈 الأداء

| حجم البيانات | الملفات | الوقت التقريبي | الذاكرة |
|--------------|---------|----------------|---------|
| 1 GB | ~1000 | 10-15 دقيقة | ~500 MB |
| 10 GB | ~10000 | 1-2 ساعة | ~1 GB |
| 30 GB | ~30000 | 3-5 ساعات | ~2 GB |

---

## 🔧 التخصيص

### تعديل حجم المقاطع

```python
MAX_SEGMENT_SIZE = 50 * 1024  # 50 KB
MIN_SEGMENT_SIZE = 500        # 500 bytes
```

### إضافة كلمات مفتاحية

```python
CATEGORY_KEYWORDS['medical']['ar'].extend([
    'كلمة_جديدة1',
    'كلمة_جديدة2'
])
```

### تعديل عتبة التكرار

```python
SIMILARITY_THRESHOLD = 0.90  # أكثر صرامة
```

---

## ⚠️ ملاحظات مهمة

1. **الذاكرة**: للملفات الضخمة، تأكد من توفر 2+ GB RAM
2. **القرص**: تأكد من مساحة كافية للإخراج
3. **الاستكمال**: استخدم `--resume` لاستكمال معالجة متوقفة

السكريبت يصحح الأخطاء العربية الشائعة:

| الخطأ | الصواب |
|-------|--------|
| انشاء | إنشاء |
| ايضاً | أيضاً |
| الى | إلى |
| جدا | جداً |
| الان | الآن |
| ذالك | ذلك |

---

## 💻 الخطوة التالية

بعد تشغيل السكريبت أوفلاين:

1. راجع الملفات في مجلد الإخراج
2. تحقق من الترجمات في `translations_collected.csv`
3. شارك الناتج معي للتحقق النهائي
4. سأقوم برفع كل شيء إلى GitHub

## 📦 السكريبتات المتاحة

### 1. `zip_rar_folder2txt.py`
**الوظيفة:** استخراج محتوى الأرشيفات والمجلدات إلى ملف نصي مجمع

```bash
# استخراج أرشيف
python zip_rar_folder2txt.py -i archive.zip -o ./output

# استخراج مجلد
python zip_rar_folder2txt.py -i ./my_folder -o ./output
```

**النتيجة:** ملف نصي يحتوي على محتوى جميع الملفات

---

### 2. `combined_text_splitter.py`
**الوظيفة:** تقسيم الملف النصي المجمع إلى ملفات منفصلة

```bash
# تقسيم ملف واحد
python combined_text_splitter.py -i combined.txt -o ./split_files

# تقسيم جميع الملفات في مجلد
python combined_text_splitter.py -i ./upload -o ./split_files
```

**النتيجة:** ملفات نصية منفصلة لكل محتوى أصلي

---

### 3. `corpus_dedup_ai.py`
**الوظيفة:** إزالة التكرارات والتحليل بالذكاء الاصطناعي

```bash
# بدون AI - فقط إزالة التكرارات
python corpus_dedup_ai.py -i ./files -o ./processed --no-ai

# مع Ollama (مجاني محلياً)
python corpus_dedup_ai.py -i ./files -o ./processed --api ollama

# مع OpenRouter
python corpus_dedup_ai.py -i ./files -o ./processed --api openrouter --api-key KEY
```

**النتيجة:** 
- ملفات فريدة
- تقرير التكرارات
- ملخصات AI (اختياري)

---

### 4. `corpus_processor_offline.py`
**الوظيفة:** معالجة شاملة أوفلاين للملفات الكبيرة

```bash
# معالجة كاملة
python corpus_processor_offline.py -i ./files -o ./processed

# على دفعات
python corpus_processor_offline.py -i ./files -o ./processed --batch-size 100

# استئناف
python corpus_processor_offline.py -i ./files -o ./processed --resume
```

**النتيجة:**
- ملفات مصنفة
- ترجمات مستخرجة
- تقرير شامل

---

## 🚀 مثال كامل

### الخطوة 1: استخراج الأرشيف
```bash
# لديك ملف أرشيف يحتوي على ملفات متعددة
python scripts/zip_rar_folder2txt.py -i data.zip -o ./temp
```

### الخطوة 2: تقسيم الملف المجمع
```bash
# تقسيم إلى ملفات منفصلة
python scripts/combined_text_splitter.py -i ./temp/data_zip_contents.txt -o ./split_files
```

### الخطوة 3: إزالة التكرارات
```bash
# إزالة الملفات المكررة
python scripts/corpus_dedup_ai.py -i ./split_files -o ./unique_files --no-ai
```

### الخطوة 4: المعالجة النهائية
```bash
# معالجة وتصنيف
python scripts/corpus_processor_offline.py -i ./unique_files/unique_files -o ./final_output
```

### النتيجة:
```
final_output/
├── technical/       # ملفات تقنية
├── medical/         # ملفات طبية
├── translation/     # ملفات ترجمة
├── ai/              # ملفات ذكاء اصطناعي

2. فعّل `--resume` للاستئناف
3. قسم الملفات على مراحل

### للحصول على أفضل نتائج
1. ابدأ بـ `combined_text_splitter.py` لتقسيم الملفات
2. استخدم `corpus_dedup_ai.py` لإزالة التكرارات
3. أخيراً `corpus_processor_offline.py` للمعالجة النهائية

### للترجمات
1. تأكد من وجود نمط "English - Arabic" في الملفات
2. السكريبت سيستخرج ويصحح تلقائياً

# أدوات VPN على لينكس | VPN Tools on Linux

## ملخص
دليل شامل لتشغيل أدوات تجاوز الحجب على لينكس، مع التركيز على Psiphon وبدائله.

---

## 🚫 مشكلة Psiphon على Linux

### لماذا لا يعمل Psiphon عبر Wine؟

| المشكلة | التفاصيل |
|---------|----------|
| **.NET Framework** | Wine لا يدعم .NET 4.8 بشكل كامل |
| **خدمات Windows** | Psiphon يعتمد على خدمات خلفية لا وجود لها في Wine |
| **شبكة متقدمة** | تقنيات TAP/TUN وVPN لا تعمل عبر طبقة التوافق |
| **برامج تشغيل الشبكة** | محاولة تثبيت محول شبكة افتراضي على مستوى نواة النظام |

---

## ✅ الحلول العملية

### 1. نسخة Linux الرسمية (موصى بها)

Psiphon يوفر نسخة سطر أوامر للينكس جاهزة:

```bash
cd ~/Downloads
wget https://github.com/Psiphon-Labs/psiphon-tunnel-core-binaries/raw/master/psiphon-tunnel-core-x86_64 -O psiphon-linux
chmod +x psiphon-linux
./psiphon-linux
```

عند التشغيل الناجح:
```
Started SOCKS proxy on 127.0.0.1:1080
```

### 2. Tor Browser (الأكثر استقراراً)

```bash
sudo pacman -S tor tor-browser
tor-browser &
```

**المميزات:**
- مستقر جداً على Linux
- لا يحتاج إعدادات معقدة
- دعم رسمي من مشروع Tor

### 3. Outline Client

```bash
wget https://github.com/Jigsaw-Code/outline-client/releases/download/client-v1.19.0/Outline-Client.AppImage -O ~/Downloads/Outline.AppImage
chmod +x ~/Downloads/Outline.AppImage
~/Downloads/Outline.AppImage
```

**المميزات:**
- سريع وسهل
- من جوجل (Jigsaw)
- واجهة رسومية بسيطة

### 4. Proton VPN

```bash
yay -S protonvpn-cli
protonvpn-cli login
protonvpn-cli connect
```

**المميزات:**
- مجاني مع 3 خوادم
- خوادم في عدة دول
- لا يحتاج تسجيل معقد

---

## 🔧 تثبيت Outline على Arch Linux

### الطريقة 1: AppImage

```bash
cd ~/Downloads
wget https://github.com/Jigsaw-Code/outline-client/releases/download/v1.15.0/Outline-Client.AppImage
chmod +x Outline-Client.AppImage
./Outline-Client.AppImage
```

### الطريقة 2: من AUR

```bash
yay -S outline-client-appimage
```

### الطريقة 3: Flatpak

```bash
flatpak install flathub org.jigsaw.Outline
flatpak run org.jigsaw.Outline
```

---

## 🔍 استكشاف الأخطاء وإصلاحها

### مشكلة: Outline لا يغير الموقع

**الحلول:**

1. تحقق من الاتصال:
```bash
curl --socks5 127.0.0.1:1080 ifconfig.me
```

2. إعادة تشغيل الخدمة:
```bash
systemctl --user restart outline-client
```

3. تحقق من إعدادات النظام:
```bash
gsettings get org.gnome.system.proxy mode
```

### مشكلة: الاتصال بطيء

**الحلول:**

1. تغيير الخادم
2. استخدام WireGuard بدلاً من Shadowsocks
3. التحقق من سرعة الإنترنت

---

## 📊 مقارنة الحلول

| الحل | السرعة | الاستقرار | السهولة | التوصية |
|------|--------|-----------|---------|---------|
| Tor Browser | ⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | الأفضل للمبتدئين |
| Outline Client | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ممتاز للسرعة |
| Psiphon Linux | ⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐ | خيار جيد |
| Proton VPN | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ممتاز مجاناً |
| Wine + Psiphon | ⭐ | ⭐ | ⭐ | ❌ غير موصى به |

---

## ⚠️ تحذيرات مهمة

1. **قانونية**: تأكد من الالتزام بقوانين بلدك
2. **الأمان**: لا ترسل بيانات حساسة عبر اتصالات غير موثوقة
3. **الاستقرار**: استخدم الحلول الأكثر استقراراً للعمل المهم

---

## 💡 نصائح إضافية

### للتصفح العام:
- Tor Browser كافٍ

### للعمل والسرعة:
- Outline أو Proton VPN

### للخصوصية القصوى:
- Tor + VPN (متقدم)

# مقارنة Wine و Bottles و CrossOver

## الملخص

ثلاث أدوات رئيسية لتشغيل تطبيقات Windows على Linux، كل منها له نهج مختلف.

---

## 📊 المقارنة الشاملة

| المعيار | Wine | Bottles | CrossOver |
|--------|------|---------|-----------|
| **النوع** | مشروع مفتوح المصدر (أساسي) | واجهة رسومية مجانية مبنية على Wine | نسخة تجارية مدفوعة مبنية على Wine |
| **السعر** | مجاني بالكامل | مجاني | مدفوع (~74€، مع تجربة 14 يومًا) |
| **السهولة** | يتطلب معرفة تقنية (سطر أوامر، ضبط يدوي) | سهل نسبيًا (واجهة رسومية، "زجاجات" معزولة) | سهل جدًا (تثبيت بنقرة واحدة، إعدادات تلقائية) |
| **الدعم** | مجتمعي (منتديات، ويكي) | مجتمعي | دعم فني مباشر من شركة CodeWeavers |
| **التوافق** | يعتمد على المستخدم (يحتاج ضبط) | أفضل من Wine الخام، لكن غير مضمون | مضمون لتطبيقات محددة (مختبرة مسبقًا) |
| **التحديثات** | دورية من المجتمع | دورية من مطوري Bottles | سريعة مع إصلاحات خاصة غير موجودة في Wine |

---

# أدوات VPN وتجاوز الحجب على Linux

## نظرة عامة

| الأداة | النوع | الاستقرار | السرعة | السهولة |
|--------|------|-----------|--------|---------|
| **Tor Browser** | شبكة توجيه | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ |
| **Outline Client** | Shadowsocks | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ |
| **Proton VPN** | VPN تجاري | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ |
| **Psiphon** | متعدد البروتوكولات | ⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐ |

## Psiphon على Linux

### المشكلة
Psiphon مصمم لـ Windows ولا يعمل بشكل كامل عبر Wine بسبب:
- يحتاج محول شبكة TAP/TUN على مستوى النواة
- Wine لا يحاكي برامج تشغيل الشبكة

### الحلول المتاحة

#### 1. نسخة Linux الرسمية (سطر أوامر)
```bash
# تنزيل النسخة الجاهزة
cd ~/Downloads
wget https://github.com/Psiphon-Labs/psiphon-tunnel-core-binaries/raw/master/psiphon-tunnel-core-x86_64 -O psiphon-linux
chmod +x psiphon-linux

# التشغيل
./psiphon-linux
```

#### 2. آلة افتراضية مع Windows
```bash
# تثبيت VirtualBox
sudo pacman -S virtualbox virtualbox-host-dkms virtualbox-guest-iso
sudo modprobe vboxdrv
sudo usermod -aG vboxusers $USER

# إنشاء آلة افتراضية
VBoxManage createvm --name "Windows-Psiphon" --ostype "Windows10_64" --register
VBoxManage modifyvm "Windows-Psiphon" --memory 2048 --cpus 2
```

## Tor Browser (الأكثر استقراراً)

### التثبيت على Garuda
```bash
sudo pacman -S tor tor-browser

# التشغيل
tor-browser &
```

### المميزات
- استقرار عالي جداً
- خصوصية قصوى
- سهل الاستخدام
- مدمج في معظم توزيعات Linux

### العيوب
- بطيء نسبياً
- بعض المواقع تحجبه

## Outline Client (من Google)

### التثبيت
```bash
# تنزيل AppImage
wget https://github.com/Jigsaw-Code/outline-client/releases/download/client-v1.19.0/Outline-Client.AppImage -O ~/Downloads/Outline.AppImage
chmod +x ~/Downloads/Outline.AppImage

# التشغيل
~/Downloads/Outline.AppImage
```

### المميزات
- سريع
- سهل الإعداد
- واجهة رسومية

## Proton VPN

### التثبيت
```bash
# عبر AUR
yay -S protonvpn-cli

# الإعداد
protonvpn-cli login
protonvpn-cli connect
```

### المميزات
- الخطة المجانية: 3 خوادم
- تشفير قوي
- سياسة عدم الاحتفاظ بالسجلات

## استخدام proxychains مع Tor

```bash
# التثبيت
sudo pacman -S proxychains-ng

# الإعداد
echo "socks5 127.0.0.1 9050" | sudo tee /etc/proxychains.conf

# الاستخدام
proxychains firefox
proxychains curl https://example.com
```

## مقارنة الحلول

| الحل | السرعة | الاستقرار | السهولة | التوصية |
|------|--------|-----------|---------|---------|
| Tor Browser | ⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ✅ الأفضل للمبتدئين |

# إعداد بيئة OCR ثنائية اللغة | Bilingual OCR Setup

## ملخص
دليل متكامل لإعداد بيئة التعرف الضوئي على الحروف (OCR) تدعم العربية والإنجليزية على Linux.

---

## 🧱 التثبيت الأساسي

### 1. Tesseract OCR مع دعم اللغات

```bash
# تثبيت المحرك الأساسي
sudo pacman -S tesseract tesseract-data-eng tesseract-data-ara

# تحسين دقة التعرف على العربية (حزمة متطورة)
yay -S tesseract-ocr-ara-best
```

> ✅ **ملاحظة**: حزمة `tesseract-ocr-ara-best` من AUR تعطي نتائج أفضل للعربية من الحزمة الافتراضية.

### 2. معالجة PDF (OCRmyPDF)

```bash
sudo pacman -S ocrmypdf ghostscript unpaper
```

### 3. واجهة رسومية

```bash
# واجهة رسومية لـ Tesseract مع دعم ثنائي اللغة
sudo pacman -S gimagereader gimagereader-qt

# بديل خفيف
yay -S ocrfeeder
```

---

## 📄 سكربت معالجة PDF ثنائي اللغة

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
"""
معالجة ملفات PDF باللغتين العربية والإنجليزية
"""
import subprocess
import sys
from pathlib import Path

def process_pdf(input_path: str, output_path: str):
    """معالجة ملف PDF باللغتين العربية والإنجليزية"""
    cmd = [
        "ocrmypdf",
        "--language", "ara+eng",

---

## 🔬 معالجة الصور الطبية (DICOM)

```python
from pydicom import dcmread
import pytesseract
from PIL import Image
import numpy as np

def extract_text_from_dicom(dicom_path: str) -> str:
    """استخراج النصوص من صورة طبية (DICOM)"""
    ds = dcmread(dicom_path)

    # تحويل البكسلات إلى صورة
    image = Image.fromarray(ds.pixel_array.astype(np.uint8))

    # OCR ثنائي اللغة
    text = pytesseract.image_to_string(
        image,
        lang='ara+eng',
        config='--psm 6'  # وضعية مناسبة للنصوص المنظمة
    )
    return text
```

### تثبيت المتطلبات:
```bash
pip install pydicom Pillow pytesseract
```

---

## 📊 هيكلة البيانات للتدريب

```python
import re

def align_sentences(english_text: str, arabic_text: str) -> list:
    """
    محاذاة الجمل الإنجليزية والعربية
    الإخراج: قائمة بـ [إنجليزي, عربي]
    """
    # تقسيم النصوص إلى جمل
    en_sentences = re.split(r'[.!?]+', english_text)
    ar_sentences = re.split(r'[.،!؟]+', arabic_text)

    aligned = []
    for i in range(min(len(en_sentences), len(ar_sentences))):
        en = en_sentences[i].strip()
        ar = ar_sentences[i].strip()
        if en and ar:
            aligned.append([en, ar])

    return aligned

def export_to_tsv(aligned_pairs: list, output_file: str):
    """تصدير إلى TSV"""
    with open(output_file, 'w', encoding='utf-8') as f:
        f.write("english\tarabic\n")
        for en, ar in aligned_pairs:
            f.write(f"{en}\t{ar}\n")
```

---

## 🧪 اختبار الجودة

```python
import pytesseract
from PIL import Image

def ocr_with_confidence(image_path: str, min_conf: float = 70.0):
    """استخراج النص مع مستوى ثقة لكل كلمة"""
    data = pytesseract.image_to_data(
        Image.open(image_path),
        lang='ara+eng',
        output_type=pytesseract.Output.DICT
    )

    high_conf_text = []
    for i in range(len(data['text'])):
        if int(data['conf'][i]) > min_conf:
            high_conf_text.append(data['text'][i])

    return ' '.join(high_conf_text)
```

## 🤗 ربط البيئة بـ Hugging Face

### إنشاء Dataset

```python
from datasets import Dataset, DatasetDict
import pandas as pd

def create_hf_dataset(tsv_path: str, test_size: float = 0.1):
    """تحويل TSV إلى Dataset متوافق مع Hugging Face"""
    df = pd.read_csv(tsv_path, sep='\t')

    # تقسيم البيانات
    test_len = int(len(df) * test_size)
    train_df = df.iloc[:-test_len]
    test_df = df.iloc[-test_len:]

    dataset = DatasetDict({
        'train': Dataset.from_pandas(train_df),
        'test': Dataset.from_pandas(test_df)
    })

    dataset.save_to_disk('datasets/hf_dataset/')
    return dataset
```

### تدريب نموذج ترجمة

```python
from transformers import MarianMTModel, MarianTokenizer, Trainer, TrainingArguments

# تحميل نموذج أساسي ثنائي اللغة
model_name = 'Helsinki-NLP/opus-mt-en-ar'
tokenizer = MarianTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)
model = MarianMTModel.from_pretrained(model_name)

# إعداد التدريب
training_args = TrainingArguments(
    output_dir='./models/medical-en-ar',
    num_train_epochs=15,
    per_device_train_batch_size=8,
    learning_rate=3e-5,
    evaluation_strategy='epoch',
    save_strategy='epoch',
)

trainer = Trainer(
    model=model,
    args=training_args,
    train_dataset=tokenized_dataset['train'],
    eval_dataset=tokenized_dataset['test'],
)

trainer.train()
trainer.save_model('./models/medical-en-ar-final')
```

## 📊 مقارنة النماذج

| النموذج | المزايا | العيوب | مناسب لـ |
|---------|----------|---------|-----------|
| **MarianMT** | خفيف، تدريب سريع | دقة متوسطة للمصطلحات النادرة | تدريب محلي سريع |
| **NLLB-200** | دقة عالية، 200 لغة | يحتاج ذاكرة GPU كبيرة | مشاريع احترافية |
| **mBART-50** | ممتاز للترجمة الثنائية | بطيء في التدريب | مشاريع طويلة المدى |

---

## ✅ توصيات

1. **ابدأ بـ MarianMT** للتدريب المحلي السريع
2. **استخدم gImageReader** للتحقق اليدوي من النتائج
3. **صدر بيانات TSV** لتحسين النموذج لاحقاً
4. **اختبر الجودة** قبل رفع البيانات للتدريب

---

> 📌 **ملاحظة**: للبيانات الطبية الحساسة، درّب النموذج محلياً فقط ولا ترفع البيانات إلى Hugging Face Hub.
